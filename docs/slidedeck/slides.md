title: Hobson Lane

 Principal Data Scientist 
 Sharp Laboratories of America
 Hobson and the data analytics team are transforming the way business decisions are made in Sharpâ€™s sales and customer service divisions, using data to reveal new opportunities and revamp existing business strategies. He brings to this challenge 20 years of experience creating autonomous devices and systems as Section Head at a large aerospace corporation, a Quant for a small hedge fund, and a Chief Data Scientist for a fast-growing startup. Hobson will share data analytics war stories where billions of dollars of spacecraft hardware and millions of dollars in sales and returns were saved and lost.

title: War Story #1
subtitle: $1.5B Asset in Hangs in the Balance

* Imagine yourself in the operations center for a $1.5B satellite
* A launch system failure has caused your satellite to tumble out of control
* Dozens of computer monitors around streaming telemetry
* As the Control System expert you must:

    1. Figure out what the data says about the satellite's motion and health
    2. Get it under control
    3. Save it before the atmosphere drags it down to the Earth

title: Not So Fast

* Your gut says to turn on the "Reaction Wheel" to get sensors pointed better
* Your gut is often wrong when complex dynamics are at play
* Your simulation (predictive analytics) are wrong
* The wheel will crash and destroy the satellite if you spin it too fast
* Your team discovers your error before catastrophy

title: Key Piece of Data

* The solar panels are oscillating in voltage so we're tumbling... fast 
* How Fast?
  - The data says it's twice as fast as what our gut says
  - You educate the team on something called "aliasing"
  - You prevent thruster burns that would have made things worse
* Corrected thruster burns save the satellite

title: War Story #2

* Our TV return rate is increasing rapidly? Why?
* What is the right denomenator (sales unit count) for each numerator (returns)

* Information Theoretic approach would produce the most accurate answer
* Sales team "rule of thumb" is much easier to explain and almost as accurate
  - Calculate the average sales "lag" to normalize the returns by
  - Aggregate report compares dealers, models, geographic locations, dates, etc

(demo or video of a typical query and lag calculation)
